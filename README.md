## Reflection

### What was the context for this project? 
    * I wanted to do more web development therefore I thought this would be a good small project to learn web development funamentals such as HTML, css, javascript, and some server side development

### Learning Outcomes?
	1. Forced me to think about design details and practice css tools such as flexbox.
	2. Helped me better understand the server-client architecture
	3. Learned how to work with api's and transfering data in json format
	4. Learned about asynchronous concepts such as promises, .then, async functions, await keyword
	5. Learned how to create end points in express and use middleware to serve files and deal with json objects
### What were some unexpected obstacles?
	* I had to follow youtube tutorials to understand how to use api's and express, which slowed me down
	* Small errors such as not waiting to load the html before doing DOM manipulation caused time bugs
	* Inexpreince with Heroku deployment and github synchronization caused errors when deploying
 

## What tools did you use to implement this project?
	* **Node.Js, Express** : Create server side for the client server model, make api calls, and load and icon
	* **HTML, CSS** : For front end development
	* **npm** : As package manager
	* **Heroku** : To deploy application online
